/**
 * READ ME FIRST
 *
 * This is the root package and the place to describe how to use your
 * software tool, platform, or framework.
 *
 * Code commenting caters to two distinct workflows.  One is the user of the code and the other
 * is the maintainer of the code.  Scaladoc is used to create a software API that is entirely
 * accessible through a web browser.  So, it caters to the user of the code.  This is
 * a black box view of the code.  Keep this in mind and write your scaladoc comments for an
 * audience that knows very little about what your software does.
 *
 * Because this is an API it is appropriate to:
 *
 *  - Plug the benefits of your software
 *  - State which versions and build tools are known to work
 *  - Provide links to a tutorial or demo to facilitate speedy evaluation
 *  - Give step-by-step instructions to setup a build
 *  - Provide plenty of descriptions and examples
 *
 * Go to [[docSample.syntax]] to see how to insert markup.
 *
 * ==How to Run Scaladoc<br/>for this Example==
 *
 * (Scala will need to be downloaded and installed for this to work)
 *
 *  1. Make a directory for the generated web pages, ''md api''<br/>
 *  1. Change directory, ''cd api''<br/>
 *  1. Run the the tool,<br/>
 *     ''scaladoc <space separated list of directories with a *.scala wildcard>''<br/><br/>
 *
 * ==Alternate Ways to Run Scaladoc==
 *  - Sbt can be used also by using the ''doc'' command.  Be prepared though, Sbt may run an older version of Scaladoc.<br/><br/>
 *
 *  - IntelliJ IDEA 11 comes with a "Generate Scaladoc" tool.  ''(When I tried it Jan of 2012 it did not automatically support the project's CLASSPATH -- it may be working by the time you read this.)''<br/><br/>
 *
 *  - I understand there is an Eclipse plugin.  ''I have not tried it.''<br/><br/>
 *
 *  - The tried-and-true method is to run Scaladoc with an Ant build.  The Scala Language API is current built this way.<br/>
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 * '''Note:''' Tested and built from the command prompt using:
 *  - scaladoc v2.9.1
 *  - scaladoc v2.10.0M1
