# A Demonstration of How to Use *Scaladoc* #

Please view the [API](http://keithpinson.github.com/Scaladoc-HOWTO/api/index.html#docSample.package) for the details.

 * Check out the source code to see examples of how scaladoc is used -- use it like a tutorial
 * The generated API can be used like a scaldoc manual -- the syntax page will probably be the most useful

<tr>
<td><b>Scaladoc&nbsp;2.10.0M1</b></td>
<td>problems with backticks have been fixed.  But if you were enclosing 
in backticks to take text out of the scaladoc processing flow, you will
need to find another solution (this works the way it was supposed now.)
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Code marked inside of 3 curly braces is now shown pretty in colors.  Place 
a space after a less-than symbol and a true blank line after a star-slash, 
until these bugs are corrected.
